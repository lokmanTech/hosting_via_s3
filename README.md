Guide to setting up a static website on Amazon S3.

I just completed documenting my S3 Static Website Project and I'm excited to share it with you all! This project involved hosting static website using Amazon S3.

Here's a brief overview of what I did:

- `Website Hosting Setup`: Hosting your HTML files and other related files on a web server so they are accessible online.
- `Enabling Website Hosting`: I chose "Host a static website" (since the website doesn't fetch any data) and entered "index.html" as the main file.
- `Accessing the Website`: Once the static website was enabled, Amazon S3 produced a bucket endpoint URL, serving as the address for accessing the content stored on the web server.

If you're interested in setting up your own static website on S3, I've created a detailed documentation outlining each step of the process. Feel free to check it out and let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance. Let's keep building and learning together!
